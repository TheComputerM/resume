# My Resume and CV

This repository contains my experiences as a developer in the [JSON Resume format](http://jsonresume.org/). 

**TODO: add more projects and publications**

## Testimonials

If you would like to provide a testimonial or recommendation for my resume or CV, please feel free to reach out to me directly or better yet, open a pull request with your testimonial added to the [references section in cv.json](./cv.json) in the following format.

```json
{
  "references": [
    {
      "name": "{{your name}} - {{relation/role}}",
      "reference": "{{your testimonial or recommendation here}}"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Your feedback and support are greatly appreciated!
